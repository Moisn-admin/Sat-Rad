# ESP32 Satellite Radar

An open-source satellite radar for the ESP32-C3 Super Mini with a 1.28" GC9A01 round display.

Using live TLE data and SGP4 orbit propagation, the device calculates and displays satellites currently visible from your location in real time.

## About

This project started as a modification of the original ESP32 Plane Radar and has evolved into a dedicated satellite tracking device.

As I am still fairly new to C++ and embedded programming, a significant part of this project was developed with the assistance of **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**. The software combines my own ideas, testing, hardware integration and project direction with AI-assisted development.

## First Startup

On first boot the device automatically starts the WiFi configuration portal.

Configure:

- WiFi network
- Latitude
- Longitude

After saving the configuration the device will automatically:

- synchronize the current UTC time
- download the latest satellite TLE data
- calculate all currently visible satellites

---

## Controls

**Short press**

Select the next visible satellite.

**Long press**

Reset WiFi settings and reopen the setup portal.

---

## Known Limitations

- The current WiFi configuration interface is still inherited from the original Plane Radar project and therefore contains some plane-related labels and wording.
- This is purely cosmetic and does not affect the functionality of the Satellite Radar.
- A redesigned setup interface specifically tailored to the Satellite Radar is planned for a future release.

---

## Roadmap

Planned features include:

- Satellite visual magnitude
- Additional satellite information
- Satellite categories
- Pass prediction (maybe)
- Improved user interface
- Dedicated satellite configuration pages
